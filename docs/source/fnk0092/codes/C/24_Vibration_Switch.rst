Component Knowledge
===============================

Vibration Switch
-------------------------------

Vibration switches is a kind of sensor that can detect vibration. When the vibration amplitude is greater than the critical value, two pins of the vibration switch will be switched on.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/24_Vibration_Switch/Chapter24_04.png
    :align: center

The internal circuit of the Vibration switch is as below, one of the pins is connected with a metal bar and the other is connected with spring. The spring will swing when a vibration occurs. When the vibration is strong enough, the spring will contact with the metal bar to make the two pins connected with each other.

Circuit Knowledge
===================================

Digital pins with interrupts
-----------------------------------

Some of the control board digital pins can be configured to interrupt mode, which can trigger interrupt event and execute interrupt function.

Pin 2 and 3 of the control board can be configured to interrupt mode. Conditions that trigger interrupt can be configured to:

+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Condition | Function                                                |
+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| LOW       | to trigger the interrupt whenever the pin is low        |
+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| CHANGE    | to trigger the interrupt whenever the pin changes value |
+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| RISING    | to trigger when the pin goes from low to high           |
+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| FALLING   | to trigger for when the pin goes from high to low       |
+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+

Interrupts are useful for making things happen automatically in microcontroller programs, and they can help solve timing problems. Ideal tasks for using an interrupt may include reading a rotary encoder, or monitoring user input.

Circuit
=============================

Use pin 3 on the control board to connect vibration switch, and pin 13 to drive buzzer.

Sketch Detect_Vibration
----------------------------

Now write code to detect whether the vibration switch is conducted and whether it makes a buzzer sound when conducted.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Sketches/Sketch_24.1.1_Detect_Vibration/Sketch_24.1.1_Detect_Vibration.ino
    :linenos: 
    :language: c
    :lines: 1-32
    :dedent:

This code configures the pin that is connected to vibration switch to be triggered by falling edge, that is, FALLING mode.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Sketches/Sketch_24.1.1_Detect_Vibration/Sketch_24.1.1_Detect_Vibration.ino
    :linenos: 
    :language: c
    :lines: 17-17
    :dedent:

.. py:function:: attachInterrupt(interrupt, ISR, mode);
    
    This function is used to configure the digital pin's interrupt mode. Each parameter of the function is as follows:
    
        interrupt: the number of the interrupt (int). Normally you should use digitalPinToInterrupt(pin) to translate the actual digital pin to the specific interrupt number.
    
        ISR: the ISR to be called when an interrupt occurs; this function must take no parameters and return nothing. This function is sometimes referred to as an interrupt service routine.
    
        mode: defines when the interrupt should be triggered.

And we configure the pins that connected with vibration switch into pull up input mode. This way can ensure a high level of vibration switch when not connected, and low level when connected. So it can cause interrupt.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Sketches/Sketch_24.1.1_Detect_Vibration/Sketch_24.1.1_Detect_Vibration.ino
    :linenos: 
    :language: c
    :lines: 15-15
    :dedent:

The following is the interrupt function, and it will be executed when the interrupt is triggered.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Sketches/Sketch_24.1.1_Detect_Vibration/Sketch_24.1.1_Detect_Vibration.ino
    :linenos: 
    :language: c
    :lines: 30-32
    :dedent:

Interrupt function should keep short, so we use a variable "isVibrate" to record whether the interrupt is triggered, and dispose it in the loop() function. And the buzzer will be connected if the interrupt is triggered.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Sketches/Sketch_24.1.1_Detect_Vibration/Sketch_24.1.1_Detect_Vibration.ino
    :linenos: 
    :language: c
    :lines: 21-27
    :dedent:

Verify and upload the code and tap on the vibration switch, and then the buzzer will make a sound.
